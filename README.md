# Kotlin-games

These are two games I developed while following the Kotlin for Java Developers course:

1.  **Game of Fifteen**: A sliding puzzle game.
2.  **Game 2048**: A sliding block puzzle game.

## Running the Games

Each game can be run by executing its respective `main` function:

* To play Game of Fifteen, run the `main` function in `src/main/kotlin/games/ui/PlayGameOfFifteen.kt`.
* To play Game 2048, run the `main` function in `src/main/kotlin/games/ui/PlayGame2048.kt`.

## Testing

The games include unit tests to ensure proper functionality.

You can run these tests from the root project folder (`kotlin-games`) using the Gradle wrapper included in the project.Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./gradlew test
